In my first Android application project, I used Kotlin to develop a geography quiz game. The game has different interactive sections like higher level quizzes, 
hints guessing and guessing the nation among others and guessing the flag. Main activity serves as the entry point having a blank homepage with buttons that direct 
users for easy navigation to different game sections. Every section comes with its own unique challenge and experience that make it interesting for gamers seeking to 
gain more knowledge about countries and their flags.

The advanced level quiz is designed in such a manner as to test the player’s knowledge ability by offering difficult questions. Guessing hints offer tips which can help 
users identify the right country while enjoying themselves in this educative game. Guessing the country concentrates on identifying countries through their flags and features
dynamic scoring mechanisms (Mebin, 2020). Randomly selecting flags for users to guess is done by means of another game known as “Guessing the Flag”. Using Kotlin along with 
Jetpack Compose for Android, I crafted an interactive UI design that is visually appealing hence proving my capacity in developing an engaging educational app.
