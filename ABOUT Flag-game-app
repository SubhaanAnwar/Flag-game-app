I used Kotlin to create an entertaining geography-based quiz game for my first Android application project. Through a variety of interactive games, this game puts players' 
knowledge of several countries and their flags to the test. Below is a summary of the changes I've made:


MainActivity.kt: This is the entry point of the app, featuring a clean home page with buttons that let users navigate to different game sections. To provide quick access 
and a user-friendly experience, each button links to a specific activity, such as the advanced level quiz, guess hints game, guess the nation game, and guess the flag game.


AdvancedLevelActivity.kt: I've made the quiz game's advanced level in this file. It controls the user interface and logic to pose more complex questions to the participants, 
making it an engaging experience for individuals who wish to push their level of knowledge.


GuessHintsActivity.kt: The goal of this exercise is to assist users in guessing the proper nation by giving them tips. I've integrated logic to show different tips and assess
user input, so the game is entertaining and educational at the same time.


GuessTheCountry.kt: The "Guess the Country" game revolves upon this file. It has user interface elements that show nation flags and input boxes where users may enter their 
predictions. To make the gaming interesting and dynamic, I've included the ability to verify these guesses and adjust the score depending on whether the responses are right or 
wrong.


GuessTheFlag.kt: I concentrated on the quiz's "Guess the Flag" section in this section. I've built up code to choose flags at random, show them to the user, and assess how 
accurate the user's estimate was. This file also manages the change from one guess to the next flag, ensuring a seamless and uninterrupted game flow.


I created interactive and responsive user interface (UI) elements for the game using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for Android, which enhance its visual appeal and ease of use. 
My ability to develop an engaging, instructive, and interactive application that assesses and improves users' geography knowledge is demonstrated by this project.
